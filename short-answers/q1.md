# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer

The difference between a "semantic" element to a "non-semantic" element is that a semantic tag indicates a "role" of the content they contain while a "non-semantic" element doesn't indicate a role as to what they may do.
